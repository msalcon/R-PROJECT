Car Market Analysis Project
Overview
This project involves the analysis of the second-hand car market to provide valuable insights to a car resale company based in Texas. The goal is to help the company make informed decisions and optimize its business operations. The analysis covers data cleaning, statistical exploration, and visualization using R programming language.

Project Structure
Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.R):

Utilizes the dplyr and tidyr libraries for efficient data cleaning.
Handles missing values, standardizes formats, and corrects errors in various columns, ensuring a consistent and accurate dataset.
Data Exploration (data_exploration.R):

Applies statistical methods to explore key features of the dataset.
Visualizes insights using ggplot2 and plotly for better interpretation.
Price Analysis (price_analysis.R):

Investigates the correlation between car prices and various factors.
Creates visualizations, such as bar plots and scatter plots, to illustrate trends and relationships.
Brand and Model Year Analysis (brand_year_analysis.R):

Examines the distribution of car prices based on brands and model years.
Uses box plots and bar plots to highlight key findings.
Accident Impact on Price (accident_price_analysis.R):

Analyzes the impact of accidents on car prices.
Visualizes the average prices for cars with and without accidents using shaded line plots.
Results
The comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into the second-hand car market. Through strategic data cleaning and exploratory analysis, the company gained a clearer understanding of the market trends, brand performance, and factors influencing car prices. As a result, the company successfully reduced costs and increased profits by leveraging data-driven decision-making.
